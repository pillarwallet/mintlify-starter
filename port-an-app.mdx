title: 'Porting your App into PillarX'
---

Porting your React app into PillarX and enabling it for use with our
Account Abstraction Infrastructure is a simple process.

The process is as follows:

1. Fork https://github.com/pillarwallet/x
2. Make a copy of the example app folder. 
3. Add your app name into to **allowedApps** in **src/apps/index.ts**
4. Copy your src folder and associated components from react app into your new app folder.
5. Install all necessary packages you need to run your app. 
6. **OPTIONAL** If it's a Javascript based app and not Typescript, you will have to resolve some Typescript related errors.
7. Finally, everywhere that transactions are sent, you will have to convert these to use (Etherspot's TransactionKit)[https://etherspot.fyi/transaction-kit/intro]
Building transactions with TransactionKit is a simple process and will allow you to use AA features such as batching and sponsoring transactions.
Our team can help out with anything you need to use TransactionKit.
8. Once you have confirmed that your app functions correctly, you can open a pull request and the team will review it.

## Detailed walkthrough of how this was done with a basic React dapp

For the purposes of this, I built a regular swap app on Goerli which uses Metamask to connect and send transactions. 

It uses Uniswap's contracts to find the swap route and complete the swap. It can be seen [here](https://pillarx-swap-dapp.vercel.app/)

### 1. Fork the repo

</p>

### 2. Make a copy of the example app folder.

Duplicate src/apps/example-app within this directory, this will be your apps home.

Update manifest.json with your apps details. You will also have to add an app icon here.

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/port_2.png"  width="500"/>
</p>

### 3. Add your app name into to **allowedApps** in **src/apps/index.ts**

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/port_3.png"  width="500"/>
</p>

Now your app will be rendered and displayed in the apps section on runtime like so:

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/port_4.png"  width="500"/>
</p>

### 4. Copy your src folder and associated components from react app into your new app folder.

Here we'll be using index as our top level file. 
Ensure it is named index.js/index.tsx and have it export the app.

<img src="/images/port_5.png"  width="500"/>
</p>

### 5. Install all necessary packages you need to run your app. 

Add all the packages your app needs into package.json and install them with ```npm i ```

### 6. **OPTIONAL** If it's a Javascript based app and not Typescript, you will have to resolve some Typescript related errors.

For instance I had to resolve the following errors in one of my components:

``` bash 
src/apps/example-app-new/components/MintButton.jsx
  Line 1:8:    'React' is defined but never used               @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
  Line 1:19:   Strings must use singlequote                    quotes
  Line 3:20:   Require statement not part of import statement  @typescript-eslint/no-var-requires
  Line 10:7:   Strings must use singlequote                    quotes
  Line 15:67:  Strings must use singlequote                    quotes
  Line 18:18:  Strings must use singlequote                    quotes
```

### 7. Use TransactionKit to send transactions

On PillarX, each user will use their own Etherspot Smart Contract
wallet for signing transactions on any app. 

On the non PillarX version of this app I was getting the signer 
through my Metamask login, now I will convert this to using Etherspot's tooling.

By the time the user gets to the app section, they will already be logged in and have 
a wallet created, so there is no need for a connect wallet button.

#### Getting the users address

I used the address in my app in multiple places to get balances etc.
We can easily swap this variable out like so:

Old method to get address:
``` Javascript
  const getSigner = async provider => {
    provider.send("eth_requestAccounts", []);
    const signer = provider.getSigner();
    setSigner(signer)
    const userAddress = signer.getAddress();
  }
```

PillarX method to get address:
``` Javascript
const userAddress = useWalletAddress('etherspot-prime', CHAIN_ID);
```

#### Sending a transaction

We can build the transaction data the exact same way as before, when 
we go to send them via Etherspot, it's a little different.

In this example we'll show us doing an approval for a token and executing
a swap, batched in the same transaction. 

First we import the components from TransactionKit

```Javascript
import {
  EtherspotBatches,
  EtherspotBatch,
  EtherspotTransaction,
  EtherspotApprovalTransaction,
  useEtherspotTransactions
} from '@etherspot/transaction-kit';
```

Then place these tags in the return part of the component you want
to use to send the transaction. These can be used to batch together 
any number of transactions.

Here we will out the components with the values relevant to our transactions.

You can read more about the components [here.](https://etherspot.fyi/transaction-kit/components/EtherspotTransactionKit)

``` Javascript
<EtherspotBatches>
    <EtherspotBatch chainId={5}>
        <EtherspotApprovalTransaction
        tokenAddress={'0x9e6ce019Cd6e02D905Ee454718F3DF149fe4e5F8'}
        receiverAddress={'0x68b3465833fb72A70ecDF485E0e4C7bD8665Fc45'}
        value={inputAmount}
        />
        <EtherspotTransaction
        to={'0x68b3465833fb72A70ecDF485E0e4C7bD8665Fc45'}
        value={'0'}
        data={transaction.data}
        >
            <button onClick={() => pillarSwap()}>
            Approve Token & Swap
            </button>
        </EtherspotTransaction>
    </EtherspotBatch>
</EtherspotBatches>
```

Once we have the transaction ready to send, the user can click on the button which 
will call the pillarSwap transaction. 

With TransactionKit, we simply call estimate() and send(), and anything within the batches tag
will be executed on chain.

```Javascript
const { estimate, send } = useEtherspotTransactions();

const pillarSwap = async () => {
    await estimate();
    await send();
}
```

### 8. Open a PR on the on the PillarX GitHub when your app is ready.

The team will review it asap.
